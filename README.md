# OutbreakTracker
Since I am not working on this tracker anymore, I decided to share the source code at least.
btw the code itself is a mess.

In order to use that "run.bat" file, you will need to install MinGW, and add it's bin folder into your system's PATH enviroment variable.
that's all... i guess?
